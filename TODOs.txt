Completed.
1. event.h/.c and object_id.hs/.c done. Documentation for these also done.


dll:
1. Have iterator store copy of current->next so we can safely remove from list. See Linux implementation.
2. Update documentation.
3. Update ecu_circular_dll_node_ctor() calls in tests since order changed. Explicitly call out destroy pointer via
void (*)(struct ecu_circular_dll_node *)0 instead of just 0.

fsm:
1. Update documentation with new event.h/.c naming convention.
