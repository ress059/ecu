Completed.
1. asserter.h/.c done. Documentation done. Tests done.
2. event.h/.c and object_id.hs/.c done. Documentation done.
3. circular_dll.h/.c done. Tests done. Don't need to test 2 nodes in same struct that are apart of separate lists
since we are already doing that with tests that use extra_list; Documentation done.
4. itimer.h/.c and timer.h/.c done. Tests done. Documentation done.

All:
1. Possible include file comments about PRIVATE members for restof source files (like the description in circular_dll.h).

fsm:
1. Update documentation with new event.h/.c naming convention.
2. Possible create an on_entry and on_exit function in a state struct for safer entry and exit events.
3. Update documentation to include @private for private members and @pre for preconditions.
4. In fsm.c change to FSM_ASSERT_FUNCTOR
5. Pictures in fsm documentation.

CI Pipeline Steps:
If any step fails do not move on.
1. format check. clang-format.
2. Compile. cmake and cmake --build
- cmake -DECU_DISABLE_RUNTIME_ASSERTS=OFF --preset linux-gnu-build // for runtime asserts enabled
- cmake --build --preset linux-gnu-build

- cmake -DECU_DISABLE_RUNTIME_ASSERTS=ON --preset linux-gnu-build // for runtime asserts disabled
- cmake --build --preset linux-gnu-build

3. static analysis. clang-tidy
4. run unit tests.
5. generate documentation. doxygen
